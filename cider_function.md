## cidr_block = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, var.in_subnets_max, count.index) ##
is using the cidrsubnet() function in Terraform to dynamically calculate a CIDR block for each subnet based on a given parent network CIDR block (var.vpc_cidr). Let's break it down step by step:

Components of the cidrsubnet() Function:
The cidrsubnet() function takes three arguments:

prefix (The base CIDR block to divide into subnets)

In this case, var.vpc_cidr represents the parent CIDR block for the VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
This is the starting CIDR block from which the function will create subnets.
newbits (The number of bits to add to the subnet mask)

var.in_subnets_max is the number of subnet bits you want to add to the CIDR mask.
The more bits you add, the smaller each subnet will be, and the more subnets you'll have. For example, if your parent CIDR is 10.0.0.0/16 and you add 3 bits, you'll create /19 subnets, giving you more subnets but each with a smaller number of IPs.
netnum (The index or number of the subnet)

count.index is the index of the subnet being created (using the count parameter to create multiple subnets).
The index value will determine which specific subnet is being calculated and ensures each subnet gets a unique range of IPs.
Understanding cidrsubnet() in this Context:
Let's explain it with an example. Suppose we have the following values:

var.vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16" (This is the parent CIDR block for the VPC).
var.in_subnets_max = 3 (This means we'll add 3 more bits to the subnet mask).
count.index = 0 for the first subnet (as count.index starts at 0 and increments with each subnet).
Now, the calculation will look like:

hcl
Copy
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 3, 0)
This would divide the 10.0.0.0/16 network into subnets that are each /19. Specifically:

10.0.0.0/16 → parent CIDR block
Adding 3 bits: This creates subnets with a /19 mask. A /19 subnet means there are 8192 IP addresses per subnet (2^13 IPs).
count.index = 0: For the first subnet (index 0), the cidrsubnet() function would return 10.0.0.0/19.
If we increment the count.index (e.g., for the second subnet), it would return the next subnet in the range:

hcl
Copy
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 3, 1)
This would return 10.0.32.0/19, which is the next /19 subnet in the range of the 10.0.0.0/16 network.

Subnet 1: 10.0.0.0/19
Subnet 2: 10.0.32.0/19
Subnet 3: 10.0.64.0/19
And so on...
Example Walkthrough:
Assume:
Parent CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16 (65536 IP addresses)
Newbits: 3 (This means we want /19 subnets, so we add 3 bits to the subnet mask from /16 to /19)
Subnet Count (count.index): We'll generate multiple subnets using count.index, starting from 0.
Step-by-step breakdown:
First subnet (count.index = 0):

hcl
Copy
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 3, 0) → 10.0.0.0/19
The first subnet starts at 10.0.0.0 with a subnet mask of /19.

Second subnet (count.index = 1):

hcl
Copy
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 3, 1) → 10.0.32.0/19
The second subnet starts at 10.0.32.0 with a subnet mask of /19.

Third subnet (count.index = 2):

hcl
Copy
cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 3, 2) → 10.0.64.0/19
The third subnet starts at 10.0.64.0 with a subnet mask of /19.

And so on...

Results of cidrsubnet():
The function divides the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block into smaller /19 subnets, giving you more subnets with fewer IPs in each. You can continue generating as many subnets as you need by adjusting the count.index.
Why Use cidrsubnet()?
The cidrsubnet() function allows you to dynamically allocate IP ranges for each subnet without hardcoding them. It is very useful when you want to create multiple subnets automatically based on a parent CIDR block, especially in larger infrastructures where you need to manage many subnets efficiently.

Final Summary:
cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, var.in_subnets_max, count.index) calculates the CIDR block for each subnet based on:
The parent VPC CIDR block (var.vpc_cidr).
The number of bits to add to the subnet mask (var.in_subnets_max).
The index of the current subnet (count.index), ensuring that each subnet gets a unique IP range.
This function helps you divide a larger CIDR block into smaller subnets without manual calculation, ensuring each subnet is distinct and non-overlapping.
